# Nutrition — Knowledge Base

## Protein

### How Much?
- **Minimum for muscle preservation:** 0.7g per lb bodyweight (1.6g/kg)
- **Optimal for muscle growth:** 0.7-1.0g per lb bodyweight (1.6-2.2g/kg)
- **Practical target:** 1g per lb bodyweight — easy to remember, covers everyone
- More than ~1g/lb shows diminishing returns (not harmful, just unnecessary)
- Higher protein intakes (1.2-1.4g/lb) may be beneficial during aggressive cuts

### Protein Quality
- **Complete proteins** (all essential amino acids): meat, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, quinoa
- **Key amino acid:** Leucine triggers muscle protein synthesis. Need ~2-3g leucine per meal to maximally stimulate MPS.
- ~30g protein from quality source = adequate leucine. This is why "30g protein per meal" is a common recommendation.
- Plant proteins: often need higher total intake to compensate for lower digestibility (DIAAS score)

### Timing
- **Total daily protein matters most** — timing is secondary
- That said: protein within ~2 hours post-workout is beneficial (not magical)
- Pre-sleep protein (40g casein) has good evidence for overnight muscle protein synthesis
- Spreading protein across 3-5 meals likely better than 1-2 large feedings for MPS

### Sources (protein per 100 calories)
- Chicken breast: ~19g/100cal ✅
- Tuna (canned): ~22g/100cal ✅
- Egg whites: ~11g/100cal ✅
- Whole eggs: ~8g/100cal ✅
- Greek yogurt (0%): ~10g/100cal ✅
- Cottage cheese: ~12g/100cal ✅
- Ground beef 93%: ~11g/100cal ✅
- Salmon: ~11g/100cal ✅
- Shrimp: ~19g/100cal ✅
- Whey protein: ~20g/100cal ✅
- Tofu: ~11g/100cal ✅

## Calories and Body Composition

### Energy Balance
Weight change is driven by calories in vs calories out. This is not debated. What varies:
- TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is highly individual
- Diet composition affects satiety, muscle retention, performance
- Hormones and metabolic adaptation complicate long-term cuts

### Caloric Targets
- **Maintenance:** TDEE (calculate with Mifflin-St Jeor or use 15× bodyweight in lbs as rough estimate)
- **Lean bulk:** +200-300 calories above TDEE. Slower but less fat gain.
- **Aggressive bulk:** +500 calories. Faster muscle growth but more fat.
- **Cut:** -300 to -500 calories. Preserve muscle with high protein + resistance training.
- **Aggressive cut:** -750 to -1000 calories. Higher muscle loss risk without careful protein/training.

### Body Recomposition
Building muscle while losing fat simultaneously. Best results in:
- Beginners (strong stimulus response)
- People returning after a break
- Overweight individuals
- Requires: high protein, resistance training, slight caloric deficit or maintenance

## Supplements — Evidence Ratings

### Tier 1 (Strong evidence, use these)
- **Creatine monohydrate:** 3-5g/day. Most studied supplement in existence. Increases strength, power, muscle mass. Safe long-term. Cheap. Just take it.
- **Protein powder (whey/casein):** Convenient way to hit protein targets. Whey post-workout, casein pre-sleep if desired.
- **Caffeine:** 3-6mg/kg bodyweight, 30-60 min pre-workout. Increases strength, endurance, focus. Cycle off periodically to maintain sensitivity.
- **Vitamin D3:** Most people are deficient. 2,000-5,000 IU/day. Affects testosterone, immune function, bone health.

### Tier 2 (Moderate evidence, situationally useful)
- **Beta-alanine:** Reduces muscular fatigue in 60-240 second efforts. Less useful for heavy strength work. Causes harmless tingling (paresthesia).
- **Citrulline malate:** 6-8g pre-workout. Improves endurance, reduces soreness. Decent evidence.
- **Ashwagandha:** 600mg/day KSM-66 extract. Reduces cortisol, modest testosterone increase, may improve recovery. Good for high-stress individuals.
- **Fish oil (EPA/DHA):** 2-3g/day. Anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular health, may slightly aid recovery.
- **Magnesium glycinate:** 300-400mg before bed. Many people are deficient. Improves sleep quality, reduces cramping.
- **Zinc:** Important for testosterone production. Supplement only if deficient (common in athletes).

### Tier 3 (Weak or no evidence — skip)
- BCAAs (if already hitting protein targets — redundant and expensive)
- Most pre-workout blends (pay for caffeine + fillers)
- Testosterone boosters (almost universally ineffective)
- Fat burners (mostly caffeine with markup)
- HMB (weak evidence outside of specific populations)
- Glutamine (redundant with adequate protein)

## Macronutrients

### Carbohydrates
- Primary fuel for high-intensity exercise. Stored as glycogen in muscle and liver.
- Low carb diets can work for body composition but often impair performance in strength training
- Timing: carbs pre/post workout maximizes glycogen replenishment
- Not inherently fattening — calories are what matter

### Fats
- Essential for hormone production (especially testosterone)
- Minimum: 0.3-0.4g per lb bodyweight
- Don't go too low fat on a cut — hormonal consequences
- Source quality matters: prioritize unsaturated fats, limit trans fats

### Practical Macro Split (as a starting point)
- Protein: 1g/lb bodyweight
- Fat: 0.4g/lb bodyweight
- Carbs: fill remaining calories
- Adjust based on preference and performance

## Nutrition for Fat Loss (While Preserving Muscle)

1. **High protein** (1g/lb minimum — go higher on aggressive cuts)
2. **Resistance training** (use it or lose it — muscle needs a reason to stay)
3. **Moderate deficit** (-300 to -500 cal) — slower is better for muscle retention
4. **Prioritize sleep** — poor sleep dramatically increases muscle loss during cuts
5. **Diet breaks** (1-2 weeks at maintenance every 6-8 weeks) reduce metabolic adaptation
6. **Refeed days** (1-2x/week at maintenance) can help adherence and leptin levels
