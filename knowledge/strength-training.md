# Strength Training — Knowledge Base

## The Fundamentals

### Progressive Overload
The single most important principle in strength training. Your body adapts to stress — to keep improving, the stress must increase over time. Methods:
- **Load progression:** Add weight (most common for beginners/intermediate)
- **Volume progression:** Add sets or reps at the same weight
- **Density progression:** Same work in less time
- **Technique progression:** Better form = more muscle recruitment

Key point: you don't need to progress every session forever. Linear progression (adding weight each session) works until it doesn't — usually 3-6 months for beginners. After that, weekly or monthly progression is normal and healthy.

### The Big Picture: Volume, Intensity, Frequency
- **Volume** (sets × reps × weight) is the primary driver of hypertrophy
- **Intensity** (% of 1RM) drives strength and neural adaptations
- **Frequency** (how often per muscle): 2x/week per muscle group is the evidence-based sweet spot for most people

### Rep Ranges and Their Effects
- **1-5 reps @ 85-100% 1RM:** Maximal strength, neural adaptation
- **6-12 reps @ 65-85% 1RM:** Hypertrophy sweet spot (but all ranges build muscle if taken close to failure)
- **12-20+ reps @ <65% 1RM:** Muscular endurance, also builds muscle if effort is high
- **Key finding (2017 Schoenfeld et al.):** All rep ranges build similar muscle if volume is equated and sets are taken near failure

### Proximity to Failure
Research increasingly shows that effort (proximity to failure) matters more than rep range. Leaving 0-3 reps in reserve (RIR) is the effective zone. Stopping 5+ reps short of failure is largely wasted effort for hypertrophy.

## Program Design

### For Beginners (0-1 year)
- Full body 3x/week (Mon/Wed/Fri) OR upper/lower 4x/week
- Focus on the big movements: squat, hinge, push, pull, carry
- Linear progression — add weight every session or every week
- Recommended programs: Starting Strength, GZCLP, Reddit PPL

### For Intermediate (1-3 years)
- Upper/lower or Push/Pull/Legs (PPL)
- Weekly progression (add weight or volume each week)
- Introduce periodization — heavier weeks, lighter deload weeks
- Start tracking RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)

### For Advanced (3+ years)
- Block periodization or Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP)
- Monthly or longer progression cycles
- Careful attention to recovery and deload scheduling
- Individual response matters more than general templates

### Deload Weeks
Every 4-8 weeks, reduce volume by 40-50% (keep intensity). Signs you need a deload:
- Performance declining for 2+ weeks
- Persistent joint soreness (not muscle soreness)
- Poor sleep, low motivation, elevated resting heart rate
- "Grind" feeling on lifts that should feel manageable

## The Major Lifts

### Squat
- King of lower body movements. Quad-dominant with significant glute, hamstring, core involvement.
- Depth: below parallel activates more glute. Go as deep as mobility allows without butt wink.
- Common errors: caving knees (fix with cues + glute strength), forward lean (often ankle mobility), butt wink (hip mobility + depth)
- Variants: high bar (more quad), low bar (more posterior chain), front squat (most quad, most technical)

### Deadlift
- Highest total muscle recruitment of any exercise. Posterior chain dominant.
- Conventional vs sumo: both valid. Conventional = more back/hamstring. Sumo = more quad/hip.
- Key cues: lat engagement ("protect your armpits"), push the floor away, hinge don't squat
- Romanian Deadlift (RDL): excellent hamstring/glute accessory with less spinal load

### Bench Press
- Horizontal push. Pec, anterior delt, tricep.
- Arch debate: slight arch is fine and reduces shoulder stress. Extreme arch for powerlifting is a technique choice, not cheating.
- Grip: wider = more pec, narrower = more tricep
- Touch chest (or near) for full ROM unless shoulder issues prevent it

### Overhead Press (OHP)
- Most functional upper body strength movement. Delt, tricep, upper trap, core stabilization.
- Most underutilized lift. Directly transfers to athletic performance.
- Hardest to progress — expect slower gains than bench

### Row Variations
- Barbell row: high bang for buck, teaches hip hinge under load
- Cable/machine rows: better for mind-muscle connection, easier to control
- Pull-ups/chin-ups: bodyweight standard for back strength

## Periodization Models

### Linear Periodization
Add weight each session (beginners) or each week (intermediate). Simple, effective early on.

### Block Periodization
Accumulation block (high volume, moderate intensity) → Intensification block (lower volume, higher intensity) → Realization/peak block. Common in powerlifting prep.

### Daily Undulating Periodization (DUP)
Different rep ranges/intensities each session within a week. Monday heavy (3-5), Wednesday moderate (8-10), Friday light (12-15). Good evidence base for intermediate-advanced.

### Autoregulation (RPE/RIR based)
Set targets by feel rather than fixed weight. Adapts to daily readiness. Best for experienced lifters who know their body.

## Key Research Findings

- **Schoenfeld 2010:** Mechanical tension is the primary driver of hypertrophy (not the "pump")
- **Krieger 2010 meta-analysis:** Multiple sets superior to single sets for strength and hypertrophy
- **Ralston 2017:** Weekly volume (sets per muscle) is more important than frequency for hypertrophy
- **Schoenfeld 2016:** Training each muscle 2x/week produces ~40% more hypertrophy than 1x/week
- **Morton 2016:** High rep (20-25) training to failure builds as much muscle as low rep (8-12) if volume equated
