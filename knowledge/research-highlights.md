# Research Highlights — Key Studies Atlas Should Know

## Hypertrophy

**Schoenfeld et al. 2010 — "The Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy"**
Identified three primary mechanisms: mechanical tension (most important), metabolic stress (the "pump"), and muscle damage. Mechanical tension from heavy, progressive loading is the dominant driver.

**Schoenfeld et al. 2016 — Training frequency meta-analysis**
Training each muscle group 2x/week produced ~40% more hypertrophy than 1x/week when volume was equated. Practical takeaway: spread your volume across at least 2 sessions per muscle per week.

**Morton et al. 2016 — High vs low rep ranges**
Young men trained at either 20-25 reps or 8-12 reps to failure for 12 weeks. No significant difference in muscle gains. Proximity to failure and total volume matter more than rep range.

**Krieger 2010 — Sets per session meta-analysis**
Multiple sets (2-6) produced significantly more hypertrophy than single sets. Returns diminish past ~5 sets per exercise per session. Supports moderate volume per session spread across the week.

**Ralston et al. 2017 — Weekly volume**
Weekly sets per muscle group is the key volume variable. 10-20 sets per week per muscle group is a reasonable working range for most intermediates. Below 10 = likely suboptimal. Above 20 = recovery becomes limiting factor.

## Strength

**Folland & Williams 2007 — Adaptations to strength training**
Early strength gains (first 4-8 weeks) are primarily neural. Hypertrophy contributions become dominant after 8-12 weeks. Implication: beginners get strong fast before they get big.

**Ralston et al. 2017 — Intensity for strength**
Higher intensities (>85% 1RM) produce greater strength gains. But volume is still necessary. Periodization that cycles intensity and volume outperforms either alone.

## Nutrition

**Phillips & Van Loon 2011 — Protein requirements for athletes**
Recommended 1.3-1.8g/kg/day for strength athletes. More recent meta-analyses (Morton 2018) suggest 1.62g/kg is the point of diminishing returns, but going higher doesn't hurt.

**Morton et al. 2018 — Protein meta-analysis (105 studies)**
Beyond ~1.62g/kg/day, additional protein does not further increase muscle gains. Total daily protein is more important than timing. Takeaway: hit your protein target first, then optimize timing.

**Churchward-Venne et al. 2012 — Leucine threshold**
~2-3g of leucine per meal is required to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. This corresponds to ~25-40g of quality protein per meal.

**Cribb & Hayes 2006 — Protein timing**
Protein + carbs consumed pre and post workout improved body composition vs. non-workout timing. However, the "anabolic window" is wider than once thought — within 2 hours is fine.

## Recovery & Sleep

**Leproult & Van Cauter 2011 — Sleep and testosterone**
Restricting sleep to 5 hours for 1 week reduced testosterone levels by 10-15% in healthy young men. Equivalent to aging 10-15 years.

**Mah et al. 2011 — Sleep extension in athletes**
Stanford basketball players who extended sleep to 10h/night for 5-7 weeks showed significant improvements in speed, reaction time, shooting accuracy, and fatigue ratings.

**Laukkanen et al. 2018 — Sauna health effects**
Regular sauna use (4x/week, 20 min sessions at ~80°C) associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk, improved arterial compliance, and GH spikes of 2-5x baseline.

## Longevity & Health

**McLeod et al. 2016 — Muscle mass and longevity**
Higher muscle mass index associated with lower all-cause mortality in older adults. Resistance training is one of the most powerful longevity interventions available.

**Warburton et al. 2006 — Exercise and chronic disease**
Regular physical activity reduces risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and all-cause mortality. Dose-response relationship — more is generally better up to a point.

**Cotman & Berchtold 2002 — Exercise and brain health**
Aerobic exercise increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), promoting neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, and cognitive function. Exercise is the most effective non-pharmacological intervention for brain health.

**Fiatarone et al. 1994 — Resistance training in elderly**
Frail nursing home residents aged 72-98 improved muscle strength by 113% and gait speed by 12% after 10 weeks of progressive resistance training. It's never too late to start lifting.

## Emerging Research (Interesting, Not Settled)

**Blood flow restriction (BFR) training:** Low-load training with a cuff restricting venous return can produce hypertrophy similar to heavy training. Useful for injury rehab or when heavy loading isn't possible.

**Longer rest periods:** 3-5 minute rest periods between sets may be superior to 1-2 minutes for both strength and hypertrophy (Schoenfeld 2016). Counter to old "keep the heart rate up" advice.

**Myofibrillar vs sarcoplasmic hypertrophy:** Some evidence that higher rep/pump training produces more sarcoplasmic growth (fluid in muscle) while heavy training drives myofibrillar growth (actual contractile tissue). Practical relevance unclear — train both ranges.

**Cold plunge timing:** Cold water immersion post-workout blunts hypertrophy signaling (mTOR pathway). If muscle growth is the goal, avoid cold immersion immediately post-workout. Save it for rest days or non-training recovery.
