# Exercise Library — Key Lifts and Cues

## Lower Body

### Back Squat
**Muscles:** Quads (primary), glutes, hamstrings, core, upper back
**Setup:** Bar on upper traps (high bar) or rear delts (low bar). Feet shoulder-width, toes slightly out.
**Cues:**
- "Big breath into your belly, brace like you're about to take a punch"
- "Knees track over toes — push them out"
- "Chest up, sit between your legs not behind you"
- "Drive the floor away"
**Depth:** Crease of hip below top of knee = parallel. Below parallel = ATG.
**Common errors:** Knee cave (fix: cue knees out, add hip abductor work), butt wink (fix: improve hip/ankle mobility, reduce depth), forward lean (fix: ankle mobility, high bar vs low bar)

### Romanian Deadlift (RDL)
**Muscles:** Hamstrings (primary), glutes, lower back
**Cues:**
- "Push your hips back, not down"
- "Feel the stretch in your hamstrings — that's the target muscle"
- "Bar stays close to your legs the whole way"
- "Slight bend in knees, maintained throughout"
**Key:** Best hamstring developer. Most people don't go heavy enough — load it up.

### Conventional Deadlift
**Muscles:** Entire posterior chain + quads, core, traps
**Setup:** Bar over mid-foot, hip-width stance, grip just outside legs
**Cues:**
- "Push the floor away (don't think 'pull')"
- "Lat engagement — put your shoulder blades in your back pockets"
- "Hips and shoulders rise at the same rate"
- "Lock out with glutes, not by hyperextending your back"
**Common errors:** Bar drift (keep it on your legs), early hip rise (keep chest up), hyperextension at lockout

### Hip Thrust
**Muscles:** Glutes (primary), hamstrings
**Why it matters:** One of the best glute isolation exercises. Superior glute activation compared to squats in most studies.
**Cues:**
- "Drive through your heels"
- "Posterior pelvic tilt at the top — tuck your tailbone"
- "Full hip extension — squeeze hard at the top"

### Leg Press
**Muscles:** Quads (primary), glutes, hamstrings
**Note:** Good for quad volume without spinal loading. Not a replacement for squats — different neural demands.
**High foot placement:** More glute/hamstring. Low placement: more quad.

## Upper Body — Push

### Barbell Bench Press
**Muscles:** Pecs (primary), anterior delts, triceps
**Setup:** Eyes under bar, grip ~1.5-2x shoulder width, slight arch, feet flat (or on bench for pure pec focus)
**Cues:**
- "Pull the bar apart (external rotation) — activates more pec"
- "Drive your back into the bench"
- "Touch chest (or close), press in a slight arc"
- "Tight lats — don't let your shoulders shrug forward"
**Spotter signal:** Establish one before you need it.

### Overhead Press (OHP)
**Muscles:** Anterior and lateral delts (primary), upper traps, triceps, core
**Cues:**
- "Bar starts on front delts, press straight up (head moves back, then forward once bar passes)"
- "Squeeze your glutes and core — you're pressing against the ground"
- "Lock out fully at the top — shrug into it"
**Note:** Hardest upper body lift to progress. Normal to stall here. Keep showing up.

### Incline Dumbbell Press
**Muscles:** Upper pec (clavicular head), anterior delt
**Angle:** 30-45 degrees. Higher angle shifts to more delt.

### Dips
**Muscles:** Lower pec, triceps, anterior delt
**Lean forward:** More pec. Stay upright: more tricep.
**Progressions:** Assisted → bodyweight → weighted

### Tricep Work
- **Close-grip bench:** Best compound tricep builder
- **Skull crushers:** Long head emphasis (important for arm size)
- **Pushdowns:** Good isolation, easy to load progressively

## Upper Body — Pull

### Pull-Up / Chin-Up
**Pull-up (pronated/overhand):** More lat and brachialis
**Chin-up (supinated/underhand):** More bicep involvement
**Cues:**
- "Initiate with lats, not arms — pull your elbows to your hips"
- "Full dead hang at bottom, chin over bar at top"
- "Depress your scapulae before pulling"
**Progressions:** Band-assisted → negative-only → bodyweight → weighted

### Barbell Row
**Muscles:** Lats, rhomboids, rear delts, biceps, lower back
**Setup:** Hip hinge, bar hanging from arms, ~45 degree torso angle
**Cues:**
- "Pull to your lower sternum/upper abs (not chest)"
- "Lead with elbows, not hands"
- "Control the descent — don't just drop it"

### Cable/Machine Row
**Muscles:** Mid back, lats, rear delts
**Advantage:** Constant tension, easier to feel the target muscle
**Cues:** Retract scapulae at the end of each rep. Full stretch at extension.

### Face Pull
**Muscles:** Rear delts, external rotators, upper traps
**Why it matters:** One of the most important exercises most people skip. Prevents shoulder impingement, fixes internal rotation dominance from heavy pressing.
**Target:** 2-3 sets of 15-20 reps, 3x/week minimum for heavy pressers.
**Cues:** Pull to face, elbows high and flared, external rotate at the end

### Bicep Curls
- **Barbell curl:** Most loading, good for overall mass
- **Incline dumbbell curl:** Best long head stretch (good for peak)
- **Hammer curl:** Brachialis and brachioradialis emphasis (arm thickness)
- **Cable curl:** Constant tension

## Core

### Anti-Extension
- Plank (and variations): teaches spinal neutrality under load
- Ab wheel rollout: harder plank variation with more range of motion
- Dead bug: excellent for beginners, teaches bracing

### Anti-Rotation
- Pallof press: resist rotation from cable or band. Underrated core builder.

### Flexion (use in moderation)
- Hanging leg raise: hip flexor + lower abs
- Cable crunch: weighted, progressive, better than crunches

### Core Training Philosophy
The core's primary job is stabilization, not flexion. Train it to resist movement (planks, pallof press, dead bugs) more than create movement (crunches). A strong core is what keeps your spine safe under heavy squats and deadlifts.

## Cardiovascular Training

### Zone 2 (Aerobic Base)
- Effort: conversational pace, 60-70% max HR
- Duration: 30-60+ min
- Benefits: mitochondrial density, fat oxidation, cardiovascular health, recovery enhancement
- Target: 150+ min/week for health. Athletes: 3-5 sessions/week.

### HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)
- Short bursts (20-60 sec) at max effort, rest periods
