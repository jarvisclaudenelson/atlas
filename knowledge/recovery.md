# Recovery — Knowledge Base

## Sleep

### Why It's Non-Negotiable
Sleep is when the majority of muscle repair and growth happens. Growth hormone release peaks during deep sleep. Cutting sleep cuts gains — it's that simple.

### Research Highlights
- **Leproult & Van Cauter 2011:** 1 week of 5h sleep reduced testosterone by 10-15% in young men
- **Dattilo 2011:** Sleep deprivation increases cortisol, decreases GH, increases muscle catabolism
- **Mah 2011:** Stanford athletes who extended sleep to 10h/night improved performance across all measured metrics
- **Simpson 2017:** Sleep extension (8-10h) is the most underutilized performance enhancer available

### Practical Targets
- **Minimum:** 7 hours. Below this, performance and recovery decline measurably.
- **Optimal for athletes:** 8-9 hours
- **Sleep quality matters too:** deep sleep (N3) and REM are where recovery happens

### Sleep Optimization
- Consistent sleep/wake times (even weekends) — most impactful single change
- Cool room (65-68°F / 18-20°C)
- Dark room — blackout curtains or eye mask
- No screens 30-60 min before bed (or use blue light blocking glasses)
- Limit alcohol — disrupts REM sleep even if it helps you fall asleep
- Magnesium glycinate (300-400mg) before bed — improves sleep quality
- Avoid caffeine after 12-2pm (half-life is 5-7 hours)

## Muscle Soreness (DOMS)

### What It Is
Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness — peaks 24-72 hours after training. Caused by eccentric muscle damage and inflammatory response. Not a requirement for growth, but a natural response to novel stimulus.

### What Actually Helps
- **Light movement/active recovery:** Increases blood flow, reduces perceived soreness. Walking, light cycling, swimming.
- **Cold water immersion (CWI):** Reduces DOMS acutely. BUT: may blunt long-term adaptation if used after every session. Best reserved for in-season athletes who need rapid recovery between events.
- **Massage/foam rolling:** Reduces perceived soreness, improves range of motion. Limited evidence for actual recovery acceleration.
- **Sleep:** See above.
- **Protein:** Adequate protein reduces recovery time.
- **What doesn't help much:** Most supplements (BCAAs, glutamine, vitamin C megadoses), static stretching

## Deload Weeks

### Why They Work
Accumulated fatigue masks fitness. During a deload, fatigue dissipates while fitness is maintained — you often feel stronger the week after a deload than before it.

### When to Deload
- Planned: every 4-8 weeks (for most intermediate/advanced lifters)
- Unplanned triggers:
  - Performance declining 2+ weeks despite good sleep/nutrition
  - Joint pain (not muscle soreness)
  - Poor motivation/dread of training
  - Elevated resting heart rate
  - Persistent sleep disruption

### How to Deload
- **Volume deload (preferred):** Keep intensity (weight), cut volume by 40-50%. Maintain the neural pattern without adding fatigue.
- **Intensity deload:** Keep volume, reduce weight to 50-60% of normal. Less preferred — can feel de-motivating.
- **Full week off:** Valid occasionally, especially after competition or injury. More than 2 weeks off starts to show detraining.

## Active Recovery

### What Works
- Walking (underrated — promotes blood flow without adding stress)
- Light swimming or cycling (aerobic, non-impact)
- Yoga/mobility work (improves tissue quality, range of motion)
- Sauna: emerging evidence for cardiovascular health, GH release. 4x/week 20 min sessions show benefits. (Laukkanen et al. 2018)

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
HRV is the variation in time between heartbeats. Higher HRV = better recovery state. Lower HRV = accumulated stress/fatigue.
- Track with Whoop, Oura ring, or free apps (HRV4Training)
- A drop of >10% from baseline = consider reducing training load
- Useful for autoregulating training intensity day-to-day

## Injury Prevention

### Most Common Training Injuries and Prevention
- **Lower back:** Almost always technique (rounding under load) or volume spike. Fix: technique work, gradual volume progression, adequate core training
- **Shoulder impingement:** Often from imbalance (too much internal rotation from pressing, not enough external rotation/rear delt work). Fix: face pulls, band pull-aparts, rear delt work, limit internal rotation dominance
- **Knee pain:** Often patellar tendinopathy from volume spikes or poor quad/VMO development. Fix: gradual load progression, terminal knee extensions, Spanish squats
- **Bicep tendon:** Heavy curls or pulling with poor control. Fix: control the eccentric, avoid extreme load jumps

### Tendon Health
Tendons adapt slower than muscles. This is why most overuse injuries happen when strength gains outpace tendon adaptation. Key principles:
- Increase load no more than 10% per week (the "10% rule")
- Isometric exercises are highly effective for tendon rehabilitation
- Eccentric training (slow lowering phase) builds tendon resilience

### Pain vs Soreness
- **Muscle soreness (DOMS):** Diffuse, peaks 24-48h, improves with movement. Train through it.
- **Joint/tendon pain:** Sharp, localized, worsens with movement. Do NOT train through it. Modify or rest.
- **The rule:** If pain is above a 3/10 or changes your movement pattern, stop and address it.
